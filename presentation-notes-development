  - blob server
  - orcid authentication
  - slack api

use express because use react (same language, infrastructure, ?same libraries?)

components => api file => cache handler ===> api response functions => database knex queries

components <callbacks<=>
api file <websocket message<=>
cache handler <broadcast call<===>
api response functions =>
database knex queries
            
? (probably no mention) styling (different styling styles for different purposes)

2 databases
Debug mode with production switch

Passing the development:
 - knex/migrations would allow switching database
 - ?good api calls readability
 - localization infrastructure
